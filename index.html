            Welcome to my course index for Graphic Design 2!
        </p>

        <p>

            This course index will serve as a online process book for the course Graphic Design 2 taught by professor Zoma Maduekwe at OCAD University. It will be continually updated throughout the Winter 2022 semester so it can document my works in progress, reflections, and my overall growth as a web-based designer.
